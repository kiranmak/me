- In-Network Service-Aware Technologies for 5G/B5G/6G
- Toolsets: XDP, eBPF, P4
- Standards Development Organizations (IETF, ITU, ETSI) Leadership
- Collaboration with Research Communities (IEEE, ACM)
- Mentorship & Technical Training for Graduate Students

### Industry & Standards Development Experience

- Designed carrier-grade software for ISP markets, specializing in **MPLS**, **VPLS**, **QoS**, and **policy-based routing**.
- Deep expertise in network architectures across service providers, datacenters, cellular networks, home networks, industrial systems, and IoT.
- Focused on next-gen service-aware technologies for 5G/B5G networks and industrial automation.
- Hands-on experience with advanced toolsets like **XDP**, **eBPF**, and **P4** for network programmability.
- Successfully collaborated with internal teams and external partners to drive innovation.
- Played a key role in initiatives within SDOs (e.g., IETF, ITU, ETSI) and contributed to research communities (IEEE, ACM).


## Current Position
**Independent Contributor**
Currently, I enjoy learning new technologies. My last project provided me a lot of opportunities to work with the universities and collaborate through open standards and open source.
My current playground is open source routing on Linux data planes. I have taken interest in building, provisioning and learning about these.

**Senior Principal Research Engineer**

**Futurewei Technologies**, *Santa Clara, CA, USA*
*Nov, 2013 â€“ Apr 2024*

- Conduct industry research on next-gen (5G/B5G/6G) network technologies. Played a critical role in modeling fixed network services to complement 5G wireless applications. The specification is available at FG-NET-2030 as [New Services and Capabilities](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/net2030/Documents/Gap_analysis_and_use_cases.pdf).

- Lead initiatives on 5G/B5G Mobile Backhaul Transport Networks and In-network services for industry automation. This involves organizing workshops and developing a generalized architecture for IT/OT convergence. Accepted a peer-reviewed paper at IIoT-NETS-2023, [proposing IPv6 extension header-based host-to-network signaling](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-km-detnet-for-ocn/) in compliance with the IETF DETNET framework. Drove an initial architecture for [IETF scope of Network Slicing technologies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices/).

- Guide and train graduate students through proof-of-concept industry projects, fostering hands-on experience in real-world applications. Mentored students through industry challenges and provided insights into career development.


## Achievements at Cisco Systems
**Technical Leader**
*2005-2013*
- Developed a generalized policy-based service architecture (ONEP) for edge services, enhancing network programmability.
- Led several programmability for edge services utilizing ACLs, IPHC, and lawful intercept, catering to ASR9K edge-services platforms.
- Spearheaded the design and development of critical Edge routing and switching components on IOS-XR and IOS.
- Hands-on experience with  distributed network operating systems for multi-card platofrms. Specifically worked on RAS (reliability, availability and stability) component of the infrastructure.

## Education
Master of Computer Applications, Pune University(Graduated *1997*) and Bachelor of Science, Delhi University (Graduated 1994).

## External Positions of Responsibility
- *IETF WG Chair for the SNAC-WG: Stub Networks using IPv6 (2021-25)*
- *General Chair of Workshops on IEEE New Internetworking Protocols (2020-22)*
- *Rapporteur for E2E Network Slicing Architecture, ETSI (2017)*
