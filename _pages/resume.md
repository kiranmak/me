## Professional Overview
Results-driven Network Architect and Tech Lead with over two decades of experience in prominent network technology corporations. I specialize in designing and developing cutting-edge edge routing and switching components on IOS-XR and IOS platforms, demonstrating a track record of solving high-availability and scalability challenges within distributed systems. My leadership is recognized in key areas, including Dataplane programmability, network slicing, and industrial IoT.

## Industry and Standards Development Organizations Experience
- Developed carrier-grade software for ISP markets (MPLS, VPLS, QoS, Policy-based routing).
- In-depth knowledge of network architectures and protocols in service provider, datacenter, cellular, home, industrial, and IoT networks.
- Focus on next-gen in-network service-aware technologies for 5G/B5G and industry automation.
- Working knowledge of toolsets XDP, eBPF, P4, etc.
- Proven and successful collaborations with internal and external partners.
- Led initiatives in SDOs (IETF, ITU, ETSI) and research community (IEEE, ACM).

## Current Position
**Senior Principal Research Engineer**
*Futurewei Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA*
*Nov, 2013 – present*

- Conduct industry research on next-gen (5G/B5G/6G) network technologies. Played a critical role in modeling fixed network services to complement 5G wireless applications. The specification is available at FG-NET-2030 as [New Services and Capabilities](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/net2030/Documents/Gap_analysis_and_use_cases.pdf).

- Lead initiatives on 5G/B5G Mobile Backhaul Transport Networks and In-network services for industry automation. This involves organizing workshops and developing a generalized architecture for IT/OT convergence. Accepted a peer-reviewed paper at IIoT-NETS-2023, [proposing IPv6 extension header-based host-to-network signaling](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-km-detnet-for-ocn/) in compliance with the IETF DETNET framework. Drove an initial architecture for [IETF scope of Network Slicing technologies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices/).

- Guide and train graduate students through proof-of-concept industry projects, fostering hands-on experience in real-world applications. Mentored students through industry challenges and provided insights into career development.


## Achievements at Cisco Systems
**Technical Leader**
*2005-2013*
- Developed a generalized policy-based service architecture (ONEP) for edge services, enhancing network programmability.
- Led several programmability for edge services utilizing ACLs, IPHC, and lawful intercept, catering to ASR9K edge-services platforms.
- Spearheaded the design and development of critical Edge routing and switching components on IOS-XR and IOS.
- Hands-on experience with  distributed network operating systems for multi-card platofrms. Specifically worked on RAS (reliability, availability and stability) component of the infrastructure.

## Education
- *Master of Computer Applications, Pune University, 1994–1997*
- *Bachelor of Science, Delhi University, 1991–1994*

## External Positions of Responsibility
- *IETF WG Chair for the SNAC-WG: Stub Networks using IPv6 (2021-)*
- *General Chair of Workshops on IEEE New Internetworking Protocols (2020-22)*
- *Rapporteur for E2E Network Slicing Architecture, ETSI (2017)*
